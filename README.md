2 bonus functionalities we added:
1) adding cherry (medicine) that if the pacman will eat it, he will get 2 more life points.
2) adding different types of monsters: two monsters decrease the score in 10 points, one monster decrease in 5 points and the last one decrease in 15 points and the pacman lost one life.

You have 5 lives, and you need to avoid the monsters. Your goal in the game is to eat all the food, or to get during the game score of over 100 points.
